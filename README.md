Your assignment is fairly open-ended â€“ you can build anything that you want so long as it exhibits:

<ul>

 <li>At least 3 design patterns</li>

 <li>Inheritance and polymorphism</li>

 <li>Generics</li>

 <li>Abstraction/Encapsulation</li>

 <li>At least 1 interface</li>

 <li>SOLID</li>

</ul>

You must make a 5 minute video, submitted on Blackboard as an MP4 discussing your design; this will be part of your grade.
